Call for chain X plus chain Y; the multichain domain at the end is modeled with both chains.

To model:
chain1(X) : histone-linker-dom1_A-linker-histone
chain2(Y) : dom1_B-linker-dom2_A
chain3(part of Z) : dom2_B
bound domains: dom1_A-dom1_B, dom2_A-dom2_B

Use the pdb obtained in the previous step. The entire sequence of chain X must
be inside dom1_B, both in the pdb and in the sequence file
The sequence of dom2_B (from second multichain domain) must be inside of dom2_A
both in the pdb and the sequence file

Call to ranch:
ranch seqXY.fasta -q=10 -x=00001chainX_mod_fixed_mod.pdb -x=dom1_AB_mod.pdb -f=no -f=no -o=no -o=no --filesuffix=chainXY -w=chainXY -i

After the run, the resulting pdbs have to be modified to move the sequence
of the chain X at the beginning of the pdb (or the end, before any HETATMs)
as a separate chain, and also move the sequence of the dom2_B as a separate
chain



#### DON'T MIND THESE

# One molecule
ranch first_call.fasta -q=10 -x=histone.pdb -f=no -o=no  -w=first_call -i

# One molecule, multiple chains
ranch first_call.fasta -q=10 -x=dom1_AB.pdb -f=no -o=yes  -w=first_call -i

ranch first_call.fasta -q=10 -x=dom1_AB.pdb -f=no -o=yes  -w=first_call -i
