Call for chain X; the multichain domain is modeled with both chains.

To model:
chain1(X) : histone-linker-dom1_A-linker-histone
chain2(part of Y) : dom1_B
bound domains: dom1_A, dom1_B

For this to work with a single run, the pdb of dom1_AB must be modified so the 
sequence and coordinates of the chain that is not bound to linkers (dom1_B) is 
INSIDE the sequence of the other domain (dom1_A.
The sequence in the fasta file must be modified in the same way. This is to
ensure that the linkers will be bound to one chain only, while the other chain
is retained with its coordinates since ranch doesn't do anything with the
contents of the domain.

# NOTE: find a way to test what happens if the atom is the same
# probably solved by putting the sequence after the second atom

Call to ranch:
ranch seqX.fasta -q=10 -x=histone.pdb -x=dom1_AB_mod.pdb -x=histone.pdb -f=no -f=no -f=no -o=no -o=no -o=no --filesuffix=chainX  -w=chainX -i

After the run, the resulting pdbs have to be modified to move the sequence
of the chain B at the end of the pdb (before any HETATMs) as a separate chain
