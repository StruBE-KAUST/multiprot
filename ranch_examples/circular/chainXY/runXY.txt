To model:
chain1(X) : dom1_B-linker-dom2_A
chain2(Y) : dom1_A-linker-dom2_B

Put the sequence of the entire chain X inside of dom1_A, and also inside of dom2_B.
Separate the domains in two pdbs.
FIX BOTH, since they were already modeled

Call to ranch:
ranch seqXY.fasta -q=10 -x=00002chainX_dom1A_mod.pdb -x=00002chainX_dom2B_mod.pdb -f=yes -f=yes -o=no -o=no --filesuffix=chainXY  -w=chainXY -i

After the run, the resulting pdbs have to be modified to move the sequence
of the embedded chains at the end of the pdb (before any HETATMs) as a separate chain
